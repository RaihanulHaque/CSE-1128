# BTech 4th Semester Graphics Project
This is my BTech 4th Semester Graphics Project inspired by the Downasaur game on Google Chrome, written in C on OpenGL API using *freeglut* library.

## Requirements
This program requires *freeglut* library to run. Install it on ubuntu using:
```
sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev
```

## Running
Compile the program inside v1 folder using:
```
gcc game.c -lGL -lGLU -lglut
```

Run the game using:
```
./a.out
```
